# Blog using localStorage

## Overview
* This is a basic blog I made to mainly practice DOM manipulation and localStorage in JavaScript.
* I knew I wanted to add a button to change some visuals on the page, to do that i made a functioning light / dark mode toggle.
* I needed to do some validation so you cant submit an form with empty input fields.

## How to Use
* Upon opening the website you'll be presented with a form.

*  After submitting the form with the required fields, you will be redirected to a new page that displays all the blogs

* You can press the "Back" button on the second page to go back to the main page.
* Once back on the main page you can open the DevTools and see in the console an array with all the blogs being stored.
* If you'd like to invert the colors on the body you can press the "Dark / Light toggle" button.
